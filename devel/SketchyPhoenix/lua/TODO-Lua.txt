:: Todo ::

	:: Write NPCs
	
	:: Document script commands

	:: Cleanup

	:: Item based scripts, namely autobonus scripts, should be updated to use lua.

	:: Removal of txt databases (replacing it with sqlite since luaSQL is already installed).
		Eventually I'll move all SQL operations into Lua, but that's not a major issue at
		the moment.
