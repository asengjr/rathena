Temporarily Changelog 
(file gets removed when changes 're getting applied on mainline / trunk)



 = Fature Related:
	

 = Core Related:
	+ Added Threading abstration (rathread, declared in thread.h) [Platforms: Windows, PThread]
	+ Added Spinlock imlementation using Interlocked functions 
	+ Added Atomic operation abstraction for MSC and GCC builds
		(This implements Atomic Increment, Decrement, Exchange, Cas [compare exchange..])
	+ Improved / Changed gettick() implementation:
		Spawning dedicated thread on startup, that ticks every millisecond to store the actual tick 
		in a global integer variable. 
		This reduces the syscalls per cycle on non-idle servers ;)
		Additionally this improves accuracy on Windows platforms due to changed timer source.
	+ Added Warning when running 32BIT Build on Program start that notifies the user
		that the tick will overflow after pow(2,31) ticks (ms) ~ 24,8 Days 
		(The server should be restarted within this time to prevent unpredictable behavior!)
	+ Added Generic (threadsafe) Memory Pool implementation, with asyncronous reallocator.
	+ Added Generic Configuration parser (raconf) which supports athena and ini style configurations (you can mix it within one file)
		easy to use interface. (Example: conf/network.conf)
	+ Added Netbuffer subsystem (also threadsafe..) for the new networking subsystem. 

 = Build / Release Related:
	+ Autoconf: Enabled 64BIT Build default (you can disable by passing --disable-64bit)
	+ Autoconf: Added LTO (Linktime Optimization) Detection && support 
	- Autoconf: Removed --enable-rdtsc (due to core changes)
	+ Makefiles: Cleaned output during build, now its kernel style. (supressing the gcc command line print.)
	+ Makefiles: Cleaned up core-deps in all projects (map/char/login ...),
		Now building an ar archive (.lib) of the core (common) and link against that.
		(This eliminates the deps to all core object files to be specified in all Makefiles of subprojects)
	+ Makefiles: Cleaned up core header file deps in subproject Makefiles, now all subs (map/login/char ..) 
		depending all .h files in the common/ folder.
	+ Windows-VC10: Cleaned up / rebuild the Solution,  added 64BIT Build support 
	- Autoconf/Makefiles: Dropped support for i586 and below for 32bit builds (Intel: Pentium PRO, Amd: K6-III should work fine)

 = Generic / Other:
	+ Replaced Zlib distribution (for windows builds) with source to be able to compile 64bit releases.
	+ Replaced old MySQL 5.0.20 distribution (for windows builds) with 5.5 for 32 and 64 bit, to be able to compile 64bit releases.
